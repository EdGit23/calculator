# calculator
A simple calculator written in python using Tkinter. Not much going on!

# Uses Functional Programming

This program uses functional programming instead of OOP, because it is a simple program. 
However, I'm planning to shift it into an OOP based program in the coming future if i add more features.

# New Update

In a new branch there is an update to the calculator
